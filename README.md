# LibQuantumJava (LQJ)

*beta version* 
*version not stable!!*

This is a crude translation from th C implementation of [libquantum](http://www.libquantum.de/) to a Java version. 

The main idea is to be able to work with CNOT / Toffoli  and other gates that are not necessary to use superposition and one needs more than 128 "qubits". 

## How to build

We use [gradle](https://gradle.org/) to build the library. 

 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gbanegas/libQuantumJava.git
cd libQuantumJava
gradle build

```



## Logo: Why an anteater?
"The giant anteater, an iconic creature of South America, is unfortunately listed as vulnerable to extinction." Unfortunatelly, this is a reality for several animails around the world since I am really worried about the enviroment I selected an animal that I would like to help.
